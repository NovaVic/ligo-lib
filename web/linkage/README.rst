Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

Deployment
----------

Database Migration :
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

linking web application uses postgresql linkage database for managing datasets and linking projects.


To migrate database, on the application root directory run :

.. code:: python

    python manage.py migrate



Celery
^^^^^^

The web application uses Celery to run linking jobs asynchronously. You need to setup a Celery broker like Redis or
RabbitMQ and start a Celery worker.

The Celery broker is provided by CELERY_BROKER_URL environment variable. To start a Celery worker use:

.. code:: sh

    celery -A linkage worker --loglevel=INFO
